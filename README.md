Hi !

- 👀 I am interested in a teacher with whom I can communicate from time to time in English, French, Dutch or Japanese.
I might want to chat with someone studying the same computer languages as me.

- 🌱 I am currently learning python and C ++ languages.
I would also like to learn html, css and javascript as a "bonus".

- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on my various projects.
I will work seriously but not in a professional capacity.

- 📫 You can contact me by mail: masaya.cactus@gmail.com

I am here to share the pleasure of IT
